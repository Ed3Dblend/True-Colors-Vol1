Chapter 2 – Through Their Eyes


High above the broken landscape, PI crouched on a ledge of floating cubes. Her limbs—part metal, part muscle—locked in place with ease. The horizon was strange: platforms hovering in the void, cables like vines swaying between them, dim light pulsing from hidden sources.
 Her cybernetic eye zoomed in.
 Below, a lone figure stumbled through the puzzle-like terrain — cautious, unsteady, like a glitch finding its way into the world.
PI (comms): “YUUSU, I’ve got a crawler on my screen. Confirm?”
YUUSU (comms): “Running Deep Eye… yeah. Lone silhouette. Newbie alert.”
A soft pulse flickered in his vision. His pupils glowed white as layered data swept across the zone — silhouettes of enemies, terrain overlays... and one unfamiliar signature.
 He adjusted his focus.
 A humanoid shape. Moving slowly. A name floated above her in faint white text: IMA.
Yuusu: “Visual confirmed. She’s alone. Tag says ‘IMA’… not in our registry.”
PI: “A blank-slate girl wandering into hell. Cute.”
Yuusu: “System glitch or another experiment?”
They both watched as the girl moved hesitantly across the terrain, glancing around like a startled animal in a cage of cubes.
IMA: “Hello?”
 No answer. Just the distant hum of energy and gently swaying cables.
Then—movement.
 From the shadows, a lizard-like construct crawled into view. Part creature, part machine. Its body twitched with mechanical rhythm, red eyes glowing beneath armor-plated skin. Claws tapped the ground like clockwork.
Yuusu: “Hostile. Closing fast.”
 PI: “She’s unarmed. She’s about to learn the hard way.”
The lizard lunged.
 The girl stepped back—too slow. Cornered.
Yuusu: “You gonna step in, or...?”
 PI: “I’ve got it.”
A sharp blast fired from above.
 The lizard exploded in a burst of sparks and fractured plating.
Yuusu: “You planning to alert the whole zone?”
PI: “Hey, some people enjoy breathing. I’m just helping her keep that option.”
Then came the vibration — deep and steady.
 Below, a wall cracked. Shuddered. Then exploded outward.
A towering form emerged.
 Six legs. Hardened shell. Dozens of red eyes. Its segmented body twisted with scorpion-like fluidity, while spider limbs punched into the terrain.
 It shrieked, and the whole battlefield seemed to pulse.
Yuusu: “Well, you definitely made friends.”
 PI: “Wasn’t even trying.”
Below, the girl ran — wild, panicked — her steps uneven on the floating cubes as the creature gave chase, smashing debris in its path.
PI moved fast.
 She dropped from her ledge, boots striking lower ground. She launched her grappling hook forward and swung past the terrain’s curve. Then she threw a grenade.
It hit the wall beside the girl—
 BOOM.
 A new path opened in the blast. Debris flew. The creature screeched.
IMA scrambled through the gap, barely catching herself.
 Just ahead, another figure stood — frozen in place. Blonde hair. Yellow eyes.
PI: “TIA! Move! It’s coming right behind her!”
TIA: “Relax, I’ve got this.”
But IMA was already running past her — and then, her foot slipped.
 She fell — tumbling down onto a lower cube.
Yuusu: “Are we stepping in?”
 PI: “Pretty sure we’re already dancing.”
She dropped into position beside them, cannon reloading.
PI: “Well, this just keeps getting better.”
