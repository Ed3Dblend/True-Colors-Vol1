Chapter 1 – A New Name

A girl awoke with a gasp, her breath sharp in the air. She was lying on a cold, metallic surface, surrounded by endless black. There were no stars. No wind. No walls. Just void.
 As she pushed herself up, the heavy weight of a strange black robe shifted around her shoulders. Thin white streaks ran across the fabric, and her damp hair clung to her skin.
 She whispered, uncertainly, “Hello?”
 No answer. Not even an echo.
 Then—
 SYSTEM: Initiating... [NAME NOT FOUND].... Reconstructing soulprint... ERROR — MEMORY TRACE INVALID… Fallback activated. Imagination sequence started.
 SYSTEM: Restarting… Restarting… Complete.
The girl froze. The voice was deep, mechanical, and omnipresent—like it came from the void itself.
 SYSTEM: From now on, you will be known as IMA… Please... enjoy your adventure.
 Silence.
 She repeated the name under her breath. “IMA…”
 It didn’t sound familiar. Didn’t feel like her name. Didn’t feel like anything at all.
 Then, without warning, a section of the darkness folded in on itself. A glowing hole spiraled open in the distance, revealing light beyond.
 Drawn to it, IMA stood and walked. Her steps echoed faintly, as if the space itself had suddenly become aware of her.
 The hole revealed a strange doorway made of spinning cubes. She stepped through—
 —and the world changed.
 Floating cube platforms stretched across a glowing abyss. Vines of cable swayed in zero gravity. Pipes pulsed softly with light. The entire space was contained inside a translucent sphere, with other shimmering spheres drifting in the distance—entire worlds locked in bubbles.
 She barely had time to absorb it when something moved.
 From a nearby corner, a creature scurried into view—part lizard, part machine, its body low and twitchy. Red eyes glowed beneath half-metallic scales, and sharp claws tapped against the floor with mechanical rhythm.
 IMA froze.
 The creature hissed—and lunged.
 She turned and ran. A laser blast seared past her shoulder, scorching the platform behind her.
 She bolted down narrow paths of floating cubes, dodging cables and open gaps. But the terrain twisted suddenly—into a dead end.
 She turned, panting. The robotic lizard approached, eyes glowing, legs preparing to spring.
 She raised her arms to shield herself—
 BOOM.
 A sudden blast of light and sound. The creature erupted into a burst of sparks, metal fragments scattering across the floor.
 IMA opened her eyes, shocked. “What just—”
 But the ground began to shake.
 The wall behind her cracked. Trembled. Then exploded outward.
 From the dust emerged something massive.
 A six-legged beast—part spider, part scorpion—its armored frame glinting with heat. Its body towered over her. Sharp claws. A thick tail. Dozens of red eyes stared down.
 It shrieked and stomped forward.
 IMA ran in the opposite direction, feet slamming the cubes beneath her. Her breath came in gasps. The monster roared behind her, demolishing everything in its path.
 She rounded a turn—only to face another wall. Another dead end.
 The creature behind her was getting closer.
 Then—
 BOOM.
 Another explosion burst through the wall beside her, flinging debris across the path. A new route opened in the chaos.
 Without hesitation, IMA dashed through the new opening.
 The spider-scorpion shrieked again and gave chase. Its claws shredded pipes, its weight crushed the platforms. Nothing slowed it down.
 IMA pushed forward, the world shaking behind her.
 And then she saw her.
 A blonde-haired girl stood across the path, staring at her with wide, unmoving yellow eyes.
 IMA’s voice caught in her throat. She tried to call out—
 But her foot slipped.
 She stumbled—and fell.
 A meter below, she crashed onto another cube.
 The last thing she saw was the giant creature still coming, crashing through everything in its way.
 Then darkness.
